# 🚀 Lunexweb Deployment Guide

## ✅ Your Project is Ready!

Your website is properly configured and builds successfully. Here's how to deploy it:

## Method 1: Upload to Existing Repository (Recommended)

### Step 1: Go to Your GitHub Repository
- Visit: https://github.com/lunexweb/lunexweb
- Click **"Add file"** → **"Upload files"**

### Step 2: Upload Your Files (In Batches)
Since GitHub has a 100-file limit, upload in these batches:

**Batch 1: Core Files**
- Select these files from your project:
  - `package.json`
  - `vercel.json`
  - `tailwind.config.ts`
  - `vite.config.ts`
  - `index.html`
  - `tsconfig.json`
- Drag and drop them
- Commit message: "Add core configuration files"

**Batch 2: Source Code**
- Select the entire `src/` folder
- Drag and drop it
- Commit message: "Add source code"

**Batch 3: Public Assets**
- Select the entire `public/` folder
- Drag and drop it
- Commit message: "Add public assets"

**Batch 4: Config Files**
- Select remaining config files:
  - `eslint.config.js`
  - `postcss.config.js`
  - `components.json`
- Commit message: "Add remaining config files"

### Step 3: That's It!
- Vercel will automatically detect the changes
- Your new website will deploy in 2-3 minutes
- Visit: https://lunexweb.com

## Method 2: Create New Repository

If you prefer a fresh start:

1. **Create new repository** on GitHub: "lunexweb-new"
2. **Upload all files** to the new repository
3. **In Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Go to your project settings
   - Update the connected repository
   - Your domain will stay the same

## 🎯 What Happens After Upload

1. ✅ Vercel detects your changes
2. ✅ Runs `npm install`
3. ✅ Runs `npm run build` (which we tested - works perfectly!)
4. ✅ Deploys to https://lunexweb.com
5. ✅ Your new website is live!

## 🔧 Your Configuration is Perfect

- ✅ **Build Command**: `npm run build` (working)
- ✅ **Framework**: Vite (detected automatically)
- ✅ **Node Version**: 18 (configured)
- ✅ **Domain**: lunexweb.com (already connected)
- ✅ **SEO**: All meta tags and schema are ready
- ✅ **Analytics**: Google Analytics and GTM configured

## 📁 Files to Upload (Skip These)

❌ **Don't upload:**
- `node_modules/` (Vercel installs automatically)
- `dist/` (Vercel builds this)
- `.git/` (not needed)

✅ **Do upload:**
- `src/` folder
- `public/` folder
- `package.json`
- `vercel.json`
- All config files

## 🆘 If You Need Help
