# Portfolio System Setup Instructions

## 🎯 Quick Setup Guide

### 1. **Run the Portfolio SQL Script**
First, you need to create the portfolio tables in your Supabase database:

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**
2. **Navigate to SQL Editor**
3. **Copy and paste the entire SQL from `portfolio-complete-sql.sql`**
4. **Click "Run" to execute the script**

This will create:
- ✅ `portfolio_categories` table (with 6 sample categories)
- ✅ `portfolio_projects` table (with 6 sample projects)
- ✅ `portfolio_views` table (for analytics)
- ✅ All necessary indexes and RLS policies

### 2. **Verify the Setup**
After running the SQL script:

1. **Go to Dashboard → Portfolio tab**
2. **You should see:**
   - 📊 **Stats cards** showing project counts
   - 📝 **6 sample portfolio projects** in the list
   - 🎛️ **Working action buttons** (Edit, Delete, Publish, Feature)

### 3. **Test the Functionality**
Try these actions to verify everything works:

- ✅ **Create a new project** - Click "Add Portfolio"
- ✅ **Edit a project** - Click the "Edit" button on any project
- ✅ **Delete a project** - Click the delete button (trash icon)
- ✅ **Toggle publish status** - Click "Publish/Unpublish"
- ✅ **Toggle featured status** - Click "Feature/Unfeature"

### 4. **Troubleshooting**

#### If you see stats but no projects:
- ✅ **Check browser console** for error messages
- ✅ **Verify tables exist** in Supabase → Table Editor
- ✅ **Check RLS policies** are enabled

#### If nothing shows up:
- ✅ **Run the portfolio SQL script** in Supabase
- ✅ **Check Supabase connection** in your environment variables
- ✅ **Refresh the dashboard page**

### 5. **Expected Results**
